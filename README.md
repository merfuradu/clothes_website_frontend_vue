# vue-project

Welcome to my frontend register-login project built with Vue.js! My application utilizes OAuth2 authentication for secure login, ensuring your data remains protected. Upon successful authentication, users are stored in a MySQL database and directed to a dynamic products page where they can seamlessly perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Also I used the library Element-Plus for the templates.

Powered by Vue.js, my frontend interface provides a sleek and intuitive user experience. With its reactive components and efficient state management, users can navigate effortlessly through the application, making interactions smooth and enjoyable.

Behind the scenes, my backend is powered by CodeIgniter4, a robust PHP framework renowned for its performance and flexibility. The backend, residing in a separate repository, seamlessly communicates with the frontend to handle data management, authentication, and other server-side operations. https://github.com/luciDevOp/Codeigniter4-Backend-Api-Register-Login

With this powerful combination of Vue.js and CodeIgniter4, my project delivers a seamless and secure user experience, empowering you to manage your products with ease and efficiency. Whether you're creating, updating, or deleting products, my application ensures a seamless experience every step of the way.
